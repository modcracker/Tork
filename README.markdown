# Tork

Tork is a rapid development, deployment, and process management system for use with the Tornado Web Server and Python.  It simplifies and automates many of the common tasks of creating a Tornado Web application.  Then, there is more time for the developer(s) to focus on the core features of the application and less time worrying about deployment.  As a process management system, it can also help with monitoring server instances.


## Quick Start

### WE'LL GET THERE WHEN WE GET THERE!

At the moment, there's no code... so you can neither install nor run Tork.  But we'll get there when we get there. :)
