# Tork

Tork is a rapid development, deployment, and process management system for use with the Tornado Web Server and Python.  It simplifies and automates many of the common tasks of creating a Tornado Web application.  Then, there is more time for the developer(s) to focus on the core features of the application and less time worrying about deployment.  As a process management system, it can also help with monitoring server instances.
